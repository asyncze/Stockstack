## Status

The hosted/packaged app has been **shut down**.

This repository is the continuation: the codebase is being prepared for an **open source release**, with documentation, build scripts, and a cleaner separation of optional services.

If you were a user of the app: thank you. If you’re here early: you’re seeing the transition in progress.
